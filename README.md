## Developmental AI

Place to host theoretical synthesis for Developmental AI.

Outstanding Issues (for preprint):

* critical periods and development

* developmental periods are facilitated by parentage, assisted development.

* stray cat analogy (different trajectories in development).

* certain paths lead to cetain outcomes (possibility tree, epigenetic landscapes).

Switch modes vs. Convergence and constraint.

Path Dependence vs. Innateness (mixed features).

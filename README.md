## Developmental AI

Place to host theoretical synthesis for Developmental AI.

Outstanding Issues (for preprint):

* critical periods and development

* developmental periods are facilitated by parentage, assisted development.

* stray cat analogy (different trajectories in development).

* certain paths lead to cetain outcomes (possibility tree, epigenetic landscapes).

Switch modes vs. Convergence and constraint.

Path Dependence vs. Innateness (mixed features).

Potential tasks:

Theory development (@ansonzlim), fleshing out and defining different components and their relations.

Computational verification / principle "testing" (FEP inspo)

Real-world impacts: Gary Marcus "Robust AI" ; Lisa Feldmen Barret, clinical approaches

Next steps?

* differentiate Developmental AI from "Regular AI", and what we mean by "development" (sequential acquisition vs. emergent morphogenesis)?

* what is DevAI (guiding document)?

* examination of the various conceptual components and start fitting them together - a Wiki?

* different papers or posts fleshing out this "ecosystem" of concepts.

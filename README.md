## Developmental AI

### Place to host theoretical synthesis for Developmental AI.

### Preprint

Embodied Continual Learning Across Developmental Time Via Developmental Braitenberg Vehicles [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344935474_Embodied_Continual_Learning_Across_Developmental_Time_Via_Developmental_Braitenberg_Vehicles)  

### Switch modes vs. Convergence and constraint.

* Path Dependence vs. Innateness (mixed features).

* canalization function.

### Analogies and Mathematical Parallels

* epigenetic landscapes vs. gradient descent (quantitative trajectories, energy minimization).

* population-based approach (agents with diversity rather than pure minimization).

* are developmental trajectories always maximally efficient? Phenotypic buffering, pleiotropy, minimally viable phenotypes (not developmentally lethal).


Potential tasks:

* theory development (@ansonzlim), fleshing out and defining different components and their relations.

* computational verification / principle "testing" (inspiration from free energy principle)

* real-world impacts: Gary Marcus "Robust AI" ; Lisa Feldmen Barret, clinical approaches

Next steps?

1) Differentiate Developmental AI from "Regular AI", and what we mean by "development" (sequential acquisition vs. emergent morphogenesis)?

* what is DevAI (guiding document)?

* examination of the various conceptual components and start fitting them together - a Wiki?

### Roadmap
